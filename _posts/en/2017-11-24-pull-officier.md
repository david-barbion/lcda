Hello,

I present you today the last sweater for my son: an "officer" sweater, made with "Sport" of *Bergère de France*, found in the book "*Tricot Kid 154*".  
It's the sweater you'll find page 10 [here](http://www.woolboetiek.be/Mag154.pdf).  
Unfortunetly, I can't  give you the pattern because the book is still on sale, although unavalaible...
A pattern for skilled knitters, that I find not so complicated, but very veryyyyyyyyyy long to knit .  
First because of the stitch (all ribbed), then because of all the finishings to knit: cuffs, collar, collar fronts, button tabs, mounting, buttonholes, etc...  
I have begin the pattern in august in hollidays, and I just end it this weed!
I am very happy to have finished it, but I don't think I will make it again soon, neither one of this kind!  
However, it worth it!

Next week I will present you a new crochet creation to warm up your little hands this winter ;-)
