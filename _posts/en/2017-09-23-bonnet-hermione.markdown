Today I present you one of the first achievements to prepare this winter 2017-2018!

As my daughters are big Harry Potter fans, what better way to warm up their pretty heads than Hermione's hat!

You will find the pattern by Christy Aylesworth in [US on Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hermione-hearts-ron), and a [French translation by Carofoliz](http://carofoliz.com/2013/11/23/traduction-jai-le-bonnet-dhermione/).

Made with DROPS Baby Merino Mix colour 19 (grey) and neddles 3mm, just one ball is enough for the hat.

I wish you a beautiful autumn full of nice projects to protect you from the cold!
