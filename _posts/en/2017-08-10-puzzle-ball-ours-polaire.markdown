Good evening to you!

Today I finished the second birth gift that I intend to give to a little lady.
This is an "Amamani Puzzle Ball" from Annie's Crochet, slightly modified as usual to make it a polar bear (the model is not shown in the book).

It is a prehension ball that can be dismantled in 3 parts, in the shape of an animal.

Hook number 3, Sunny yarn of Cheval Blanc 100% mercerized cotton, white, pearl and black.
Explanations are subject to a fee and I am not able to provide them free of charge here.
However, you can find them on the [Annie's Craft Store website](https://www.anniescatalog.com/detail.html?prod_id=113005&source=rvlry) or you can purchase the book on your own on the internet.

New creations are in progress, so I'll see you soon on Le Crochet d' Argent!

I wish you a beautiful day!
