Good morning!

A little tinker inspired by the crochet-friends and their pretty creations published on facebook groups!

A simple and fast version (approx. 4 hours) to make:
- a double-crochet rectangle  
- tulle to close the "rectangle" in the back and to make the shoulders,
- still tulle for the skirt

{% include gallery-layout.html gallery=site.data.galleries.petite-fee %}

Have a nice day!

Hélène
