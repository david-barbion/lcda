Hi!

Today I present you the second shawl in original creation Le Crochet d' Argent: A Mermaid Tale.  
Find in the article the free tutorial, in writing and in diagrams ;-) !

{% include gallery-layout.html gallery=site.data.galleries.a-mermaid-tale-1 id_number=1 %}

A Mermaid Tale is a shawl that begins as a semicircle ans ends as a triangle.  
The pattern is made in 2 parts : the semicircle at the first time, and triangle and edge at second time.  
This shawl with modern colors is made with merino Freïa handpaint yarn, « cruelty free », and Blue Velvet color. (I use 2 skein of 393m.)  
Made with E hook (3,5mm), it measure after bloking 140x76 cm  
It’s up to you to play with gradients colors, so have fun!

## Part 2

Now you should mentally divide your shawl in 3 parts to create the triangle. The number of stitches I give is for indicative, so you may not have the same as me.  
Nevermind, take approximately 60 stitches to each side of the semicircle, so that you have a number of stitches divisible by 3.

Row35 : sc1 in the 60 dc of the previous row, \*ch5, skipt 2 st, sc1 in the third stitch\*, repeat on the 99 central stitches, then sc1 to each dc.

We work now with the fancy stitch (cf diagram).  
Every 2 rows, increase at beginning and at end of each row by crocheting 2 sc in the first and the last stitch of the previous row.  
You should sometimes crochet 3sc at beginning of the row for respecting the fancy stitch (sc in a space/ch1)  
To each row you will have 2 hoops less to each side, until there is only one.  

Row36 : sc2 in the first st, \*ch1, sc1 in next space\* until the 2 last stitch before hoop, sc1  in the 2 sc before the hoops, sc3 in the first hoop, \*ch5, sc1 in next hoop\*, repeat until the last hoop, sc3 in the last hoop, sc2 in the first 2 stitches of the previous row, \*ch1, sc1 in next space\*, sc2 in the last stitch.

Row 37 : ch1 , sc1 in the first stitch, \*ch1, sc1 in next space\*, repeat until the 2 last stitch before hoop, sc1  in the 2 sc before the hoops , sc3 in the first hoop, \*ch5, sc1 in next hoop\*, repeat until the last hoop, sc3 in the last hoop, sc2 in the first 2 stitches of the previous row, \*ch1, sc1 in next space\*, sc1 in the last stitch.

Always repeat this 2-rows until you have one central-hoop.  
So repeat one more time 1 row of fancy stitch.  
Crochet in the central-hoop : sc3, ch1, sc3.  

You have made the triangle.

## Edge

hdc2 in the last stitch of the prev row, hdc1 to each sc and each space of the prev row, hdc1/ch2/hdc1 in the central space, hdc1 to each sc and each space of the prev row, hdc2 in last stitch.

Last row : ch3/dc4 in the forst st, \*skip 3 stitches, dc7 in the next stitch, skip 3 st, sc1 in next st\* repeat until the point, sc3 in ch2 of the prev row, \*skip 3 st, dc7 in next st, skip 3st, sc1 in the next stitch\*, skip 3stitch, dc5 in the last stitch.

Fasten off, block and wear !
