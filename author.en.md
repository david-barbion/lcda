Hello,

My name is Hélène, and I have been passionate about the yarn arts for many years.   
After starting with countdown stitch embroidery, then on printed canvas, I started with crochet and then knitting, accompanied by my mummy like many of us.  
As a real all-rounder in creative leisure activities, I like to compose and create original models myself and I'm always on the lookout for new techniques to try!

I am also a fervent supporter of creative sharing freedoms, so most of the designs you find here will be free, delivered under license [Creative-Commons BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), know that you will be able to share them under the same conditions, modify them, but always quoting me as the original creator.

If you would like to contact me to exchange ideas, share ideas, projects, or just say hello, don't hesitate to write to me at:
<contact@lecrochetdargent.fr>




See you soon!

LN
